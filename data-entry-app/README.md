Install Dependencies```bashnpm install```### 2. Set Up Supabase#### Create a Supabase Project1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)2. Sign up or log in to your account3. Click "New Project"4. Fill in your project details:   - **Name**: Choose a project name   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save this!)   - **Region**: Choose the closest region to your users5. Click "Create new project" and wait for it to be set up (takes 1-2 minutes)#### Get Your Supabase Credentials1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**2. You'll find:   - **Project URL**: Copy this value   - **anon/public key**: Copy this value (this is safe to use in frontend)#### Configure Environment Variables1. **For Local Development:**   Create a `.env` file in the project root:   ```bash   # Create .env file for local development   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-actual-project-url   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key   ```2. **For Production Builds (Docker):**   Copy the production environment template:   ```bash   cp env.production.example .env.production   ```   Then edit `.env.production` with your actual values:   ```env   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-actual-project-url   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key   ```      **Note:** The `.env.production` file is used during Docker builds. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for more details.### 3. Run the Development Server```bashnpm run dev```The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`## Development LoginFor development purposes, you can log in with:- **Username**: `admin`- **Password**: `admin`This will grant you admin role with full access.## Project Structure```data-entry-app/├── src/│   ├── components/       # React components│   │   ├── Dashboard.tsx│   │   ├── Header.tsx│   │   ├── Login.tsx│   │   ├── ProtectedRoute.tsx│   │   └── Sidebar.tsx│   ├── contexts/         # React contexts│   │   ├── AuthContext.tsx│   │   ├── RBACContext.tsx│   │   └── SettingsContext.tsx│   ├── constants/        # Constants and configurations│   │   └── roles.ts│   ├── lib/             # Library files│   │   └── supabase.ts│   ├── services/        # Business logic services│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions│   ├── App.tsx          # Main app component│   ├── main.tsx         # Entry point│   └── index.css        # Global styles with dark mode├── public/              # Static assets├── .env.example         # Environment variables template└── package.json         # Dependencies```## Available Scripts- `npm run dev`: Start development server- `npm run build`: Build for production- `npm run preview`: Preview production build- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint## Role Permissions### Admin- Full access to all features- Can create, read, update, and delete all resources- Can manage users and settings### Editor- Can create and edit data entries- Can create and edit inventory items- Can view and create reports- **Cannot** delete critical resources- **Cannot** manage users or settings### Viewer- Read-only access- Can view data entries- Can view inventory- Can view reports- **Cannot** create, edit, or delete anything## Dark ModeThe application supports three theme modes:- **Light**: Always use light theme- **Dark**: Always use dark theme- **Auto**: Follow system preferenceToggle the theme using the sun/moon icon in the header.## Next Steps1. **Set up Database Tables**: Create your database schema in Supabase2. **Implement Data Entry Forms**: Build forms for data entry3. **Add Inventory Management**: Implement inventory tracking features4. **Create Reports Dashboard**: Build analytics and reporting features5. **Configure Authentication**: Set up proper Supabase authentication (currently using dev login)## Troubleshooting### Environment Variables Not Working- Make sure your `.env` file is in the root directory- Restart the development server after changing `.env`- Check that variable names start with `VITE_`### Supabase Connection Issues- Verify your Supabase project is active- Check that your URL and anon key are correct- Ensure your Supabase project has authentication enabled### Build Errors- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be v18+)## LicenseThis project is private and proprietary.## SupportFor issues or questions, please contact the development team.#### _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________# Project Modules1. Master Data Entry    - **District** Beneficiaries:        - Select District name, list of articles and its quantity, comments.         - Prices are autofilled from a Articles list. Articles with             0(unknown or Fluctuating) prices are manually entered.        - Multiples entries are allowed in case of Aid or Project and advised to add comments to uniquely identify.   - **Public** Beneficiaries     - Beneficiaries have only one Article or Aid     - Each Beneficiary is verified with their past records and present based on Aadhar Number. But can be considered in some cases.     - No budget alloted. but we check the total    - **Institution & Other** Beneficiaries     - Institutions handle multiple articles and aids. No verification needed     - No Budget alloted, but we calculate only the total accrued.2. Article Management   - Manage list of articles , its high level and Medium level category, price, etc3. Order Management - (Requirement overview)    - Sum of its Requirement based on Beneficiaries and ordered status4. Ordering and Fundraising   - We need two tightly linked features built on a single item master so there is no duplication or mismatch: first,    an Order Overview menu that acts as a live dashboard showing every required item with total needed, ordered, pending    and funded quantities, where clicking an item reveals beneficiary types and counts, and where status indicators are    colour coded green if fully ordered and funded, red if not ordered or not funded, and amber if partial or excess;    second, an Order and Fundraising management menu where orders are created via a vendor-facing form capturing vendor    details, quoted article names, quantities, prices and tax, with each vendor article mandatorily mapped to an internal    item to generate and store a purchase order PDF, and where fundraising reuses the same order data without re-entry,   adds Aid and Project Type which must be linked exactly to specific records and Article Type which can be linked generally,    and generates a separate fundraising PDF, with both order and fundraising outputs automatically updating the Order    Overview status based on computed required, ordered and funded values from Supabase-backed relational tables.5. Waiting Hall Quantity vs Stage Quantity      - After communicating with the Beneficiaries these values are decided      - How many do they collect at Waiting Hall in Bulk vs How many they collect at the Stage      - Tokens are alloted only for Stage Quantity and Acknowledgment Receipt is provided for Hall quantity      - Chairs are alloted based on this Stage Quantity6. Sequence List    - Sequence order for Stage distribution. Major and Lite article are first moved and the heavy are kept in place for last.    - numbers range from 1 to N.    - Article list and sequence number colums are merged with the finalised Master data    - display a  table that is editable with filters to add seq number7. Token generation    - based on the Finalised master data and the Sequence and within sequence in the order of  District, Public, instn.    - Add a upload csv option , that will provide options to downlaod tokens by District level(beneficiary token) and article level(stick on article)    - Chair Label, VIP label, 2L labels, etc 8. Reports    - From the Master record , we use it as final to create reports.       - Article wise District      - District wise articles      - Consolidated report for diaz and VIPs      - other reports9. Dashboards     - Summary of modules ( Inventory, Master data, Data collection completed or not status, etc)10. User Management 11. Audit Logs
